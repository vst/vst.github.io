Today marks the end of my monthly blogging challenge. I wrote a blog post every
day for a month. Here is how it went and what I learned.

## Motivation

I am not a social media user. I do not have a Facebook, Instagram, or a TikTok
account. I have an X/Twitter account, but I do not use it unless a friend shares
a tweet with me. I use Reddit for my occupational interest, but I do not post
there.

About a month ago, a good friend of mine challenged me to write on a daily
basis. He knows me well, so he went easy on me and suggested that it can be
anything: Blog post, tweet, Reddit comment, etc. I accepted the challenge and
decided to write a blog post every day for a month.

## Confidence Through Obsession

Why did I accept the challenge? In particular, why did I choose to write a blog
post which is more involved than a tweet or a Reddit comment?

Let's side track a little bit. Take a look at the following piece of code:

```typescript
const startedAt = "2024-01-01";
const finishedAt = "2024-01-31";
```

Simple, right? Not for me:

1. Variable names are not of the same length, therefore they do not align.
2. The alphabetic order of the variable names are not the same as in their
   meaning: `s` comes after `f`, but `startedAt` date is before `finishedAt`
   date in the calendar.

I remember the day when I figured this out:

```typescript
const since = "2024-01-01";
const until = "2024-01-31";
```

I felt so accomplished as if I had solved a complex problem. I know it is silly,
but it is what it is.

What does it have to do with the blogging challenge?

Firstly, I am usually obsessed with small and insignificant details. So, I knew
that I would be stuck anyway. Might as well, be stuck on something that I can be
proud of if I succeed and have a _better_ excuse if I fail.

Secondly, I have continuously challenged myself in the past for various things.
I have failed in most of them. But the ones I managed to complete made
significant change in my life.

So, I decided to channel my obsession to positive and significant things, hence
the blogging challenge.

## Difficulties

At the beginning, I knew that the challenge was difficult for at least two
reasons:

1. Write and publish something that I know is not good enough.
2. Find time to write every single day.

I was right. It was even more difficult than I thought.

The major difficulty was not about finding time. It affected my night routine
causing me to sleep late and wake up relatively late (about 6:30am, still early
for most people). But it is OK, I managed it.

The actual challenge turned out to be the anxiety of:

1. publishing something that I am embarrassed of (as anticipated), and
2. trying to figure out what to write about.

### 1. Dealing with Embarassment

The invitation to this challenge came with a disclaimer: Quantity over Quality.
So, embarrassment was not hypothetical, but expected. I was ready to deal with
it.

Everytime I felt embarrassed about a post, I reminded myself of this anectodal
fact: The main reason that I could not finish my PhD studies (not one, but two)
was not publishing my research. Yes, I did not have much time because of my
entrepreneurial adventures, but I could have done it if I had published my
research without worrying much about "quality". Indeed, prior studies, research,
articles and proficiency exams are all delivered when I was poor of time,
anyway. So, I failed to finish my PhDs only because of anxiety, not because of
time.

Another thought that helped me was to remind myself that nobody cares. Most
people do not even know me.

So, I doubled down in this respect, and I almost never read my blog posts before
publishing them (I am reading this one now). I did not use a spell checker,
grammar checker or AI writing assistant. At some point, I even disabled GitHub
Copilot when writing my posts.

### 2. Finding Topics

I have a few hobbies, but I am not an expert in any of them. I no longer engage
in political discussions. But I am a programmer by profession, and a life-style
entrepreneur by choice. I picked "hacking" as a topic and wrote about it
everyday.

I sometimes picked a topic that I had no idea about, such as using `diagrams`
library in Haskell. I learned a lot from these posts.

## Outcome

First of all, I completed the challenge. This is a big win for me.

Secondly, I started developing some heuristics about writing. For example, I now
have a better idea about how much time it takes to write a blog post of a
certain length and complexity. I can anticipate better when I am cornering
myself with a wrong topic or flow of thought.

Thirdly, I have a better understanding about audience. Nobody knows my
[Website], but I cross-posted my blog posts to [dev.to] and [Hashnode]. I even
posted [one of my posts] to [Haskell subreddit] that was eventually published on
[Haskell Weekly]. If the post is "fun to read" --- as a friend has put it --- it
can get traction even on expert topics. If it is too general, it gets traction
only on popular topics.

Lastly, I managed to get about 1,000 reads on my [Website], 1,000 reads on
[dev.to] and 200 reads on [Hashnode] in a month. I did not manage to engage with
audience, but I am happy with these numbers. If somebody would ask me before the
challenge, 10 was as much as I could hope for, and 10,000 would be no different
than 10 as I had no idea about the magnitude.

## Conclusion

I am happy that I completed the challenge. I have learned a lot, too. Going
forward, I may not write everyday, but I am planning to write regularly,
hopefully in a form that is more engaging and useful for others.
