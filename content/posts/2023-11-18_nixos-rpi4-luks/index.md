This guide documents how to install NixOS on Raspberry Pi 4 with an encrypted
root filesystem.

## Background and Motivation

First, a little bit of background:

- [Raspberry Pi 4] is a single-board computer based on ARM architecture with
  enough CPU power and RAM capacity that allows running a good deal of
  computational tasks.
- [NixOS] is a GNU/Linux operating system distribution that is built on top of
  the [Nix Package Manager] enabling users to declaratively configure their
  systems and reproduce such configuration on different hosts or the same host
  over time using rollbacks.
- The encrypted filesystem is a security practice that allows users to encrypt
  their entire root filesystem or parts of it to ensure that third parties can
  not extract information without the encryption key from the underlying media
  (physical or virtual) once taken offline.

I have access to a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of RAM and an external SSD. It proved
to be quite usable as a workstation. I tested it to see if I can:

1. run productivity tools such as a Web browser or an office suite,
2. perform work activities such as Haskell development using Emacs and
   `lsp-haskell` or React-based Web application development using VS Code, and
3. deploy services using Docker and Docker Compose.

To my surprise, I found it quite usable. A significant number of tasks can be
performed without noticing that the host is a computer costing less than 100
dollars. It should be noted that SSD is quite critical, though. Because using a
micro-SD card for the root filesystem will ruin the entire experience.

On the other hand, I can reproduce my NixOS-based workstation configuration
easily on different hosts. I already have almost identical workstations in my
reach. _Almost_, because certain states can not be easily reproduced or the
benefits are not worth the hassle (such as ad-hoc data files, Web browser cache
or ephemeral development, build and testing artefacts).

So, I decided to setup a new workstation on my Raspberry Pi 4. However, it would
not be an option for me without an encrypted root filesystem. I thought that it
would be possible but tedious. It turned out to be quite straightforward.

The rest of this guide documents how to install NixOS on Raspberry Pi 4 (`rpi4`)
with an encrypted root filesystem in a step-by-step fashion.

## Installation Media

Download SD card image from Hydra:

<https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixos/release-23.05/nixos.sd_image.aarch64-linux>

This guide specifically uses this file from `2023-10-26`:

```txt
nixos-sd-image-23.05.4527.60b9db998f71-aarch64-linux.img.zst
```

... from:

<https://hydra.nixos.org/build/239386976>

... by issuing the command:

```sh
nix-shell -p aria2 --run "aria2c -c --dir /tmp/nixos-image/ https://hydra.nixos.org/build/239386976/download/1/nixos-sd-image-23.05.4527.60b9db998f71-aarch64-linux.img.zst"
```

Then, uncompress the image:

```sh
nix-shell -p zstd --run "unzstd /tmp/nixos-image/nixos-sd-image-23.05.4527.60b9db998f71-aarch64-linux.img.zst"
```

Find the USB disk (or micro-SD card) device path:

```sh
lsblk
```

Write the image:

```sh
sudo dd if=/tmp/nixos-image/nixos-sd-image-23.05.4527.60b9db998f71-aarch64-linux.img of=/dev/<YOUR_DISK_OR_CARD>
```

## Booting

You need to:

1. boot from the image you burned above,
1. attach the actual disk you want to install to (you can do this later, too),
1. attach a keyboard and a monitor, and
1. have access to a wired or wireless network.

As for network access, this guide assumes a wired network so as not to conflate
the post any further. I used a wireless network myself first, and then,
reproduced instructions later on a wired network.

Once you successfully boot your rpi4 from your NixOS image, follow the
subsections below.

### Network Configuration

Check if the network connection is established:

```sh
ping google.com
```

Find the interface name and the IP address assigned to it:

```sh
ip a
```

In my case, and most likely in your case, it is `eth0`:

```sh
ip a show dev eth0
```

Note the IP address, because we will use it in the next step.

### SSH Connection

We want to continue the installation from a _proper_ workstation. Luckily, the
installation media already launched an SSH service. Therefore, we will setup
authorised SSH keys, switch to the workstation and continue installation there.

First, add your SSH keys to your rpi4. I am using my SSH public keys stored on
my GitHub account:

```sh
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
curl https://github.com/<GITHUB-USERNAME>.keys -o ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now, switch to your workstation, and connect to your rpi4:

```sh
ssh nixos@<RPI4-IP-ADDRESS>
```

Optionally, launch a screen on your rpi4 and follow the installation procedure
inside:

```sh
screen -S INSTALLATION
```

## Partitioning

First, connect the disk that you will install the root filesystem to. Then,
check device information:

```sh
lsblk
```

In my case, it is `/dev/sda`. Find yours, and export it as a shell environment
variable:

```sh
export DEVICE_ROOT="/dev/sda"
```

Also, export your installation media disk path (in my case, it is `/dev/sdb`):

```sh
export DEVICE_INST="/dev/sdb"
```

Next, wipe the data on the disk:

```sh
sudo wipefs -a "${DEVICE_ROOT}"
```

And create 2 partitions (one for boot partition and one for LUKS partition):

```sh
sudo parted "${DEVICE_ROOT}" -- mklabel gpt
sudo parted "${DEVICE_ROOT}" -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 512MiB
sudo parted "${DEVICE_ROOT}" -- set 1 boot on
sudo parted "${DEVICE_ROOT}" -- mkpart primary 512MiB 100%
```

> Note that `parted` may warn you about optimal disk alignment. You may ignore
> them. This is possibly due to the quality of the USB disk enclosure or
> connector. It seems that some USB-connected disks are misrepresented in their
> optimal configuration, which confuses the alignment calculations and results
> in bogus warnings. I do not know any further.

Now, setup the encrypted LUKS partition, and open it:

```sh
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat "${DEVICE_ROOT}2"
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen "${DEVICE_ROOT}2" enc-pv
```

Next, we will create two logical volumes on the LUKS partition:

1. One for a 8GB swap partition, and
2. The rest for our root filesystem.

```sh
sudo pvcreate /dev/mapper/enc-pv
sudo vgcreate vg /dev/mapper/enc-pv
sudo lvcreate -L 8G -n swap vg
sudo lvcreate -l '100%FREE' -n root vg
```

Format the partitions and volumes:

```sh
sudo mkfs.fat "${DEVICE_ROOT}1"
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/vg/root
sudo mkswap -L swap /dev/vg/swap
```

Then, mount filesystems:

```sh
sudo mount /dev/vg/root /mnt
sudo mkdir /mnt/boot
sudo mount "${DEVICE_ROOT}1" /mnt/boot
sudo swapon /dev/vg/swap
```

Finally, copy the firmware from your installation media to your boot partition:

```sh
sudo mkdir /firmware
sudo mount "${DEVICE_INST}1" /firmware
sudo cp /firmware/* /mnt/boot
sudo umount /firmware
```

## Installation

Generate NixOS configuration:

```sh
sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
```

Now, note the device ID of unencrypted `${DEVICE_ROOT}2` (`/dev/sda2` in my
case, `37e51822-c30e-4027-a746-562778c20df0`):

```sh
lsblk --fs
```

Now, change the below according to your needs (`let` section should be enough)
and put it in your `/mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file on rpi4:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

let
  luksroot = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/37e51822-c30e-4027-a746-562778c20df0";
  hostname = "pixos";
  timezone = "UTC";
  username = "patron";
  sshkeys = [
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nz..."
    "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nz..."
  ];
in
{
  ## Perform required imports:
  imports = [
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
  ];

  ## Boot configuration:
  boot = {
    ## Boot loader configuration:
    loader = {
      ## Disable GRUB to use the extlinux boot loader (NixOS wants to enable GRUB by default):
      grub.enable = false;

      ## Enables the generation of /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf:
      generic-extlinux-compatible.enable = true;
    };

    ## Use the kernel packaged for Raspberry Pi 4:
    kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxKernel.packages.linux_rpi4;

    ## Configure initrd for LUKS root:
    initrd.luks.devices.luksroot = {
      device = luksroot;
      preLVM = true;
      allowDiscards = true;
    };
  };

  ## Set the timezone:
  time.timeZone = timezone;

  ## Set default locale:
  i18n.defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8";

  ## Configure console:
  console = {
    font = "Lat2-Terminus16";
    keyMap = "us";
  };

  ## Configure networking:
  networking = {
    ## Set the hostname:
    hostName = hostname;

    ## Enable Network Manager:
    networkmanager.enable = true;

    ## Enable and configure firewall:
    firewall = {
      enable = true;
      allowedTCPPorts = [ ];
      allowedUDPPorts = [ ];
    };
  };

  ## Setup services:
  services = {
    ## Enable the OpenSSH service:
    openssh.enable = true;
  };

  ## Install system-wide packages:
  environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.vim
    pkgs.wget
  ];

  ## Create a user:
  users.users."${username}" = {
    isNormalUser = true;
    extraGroups = [
      "wheel"
    ];
    packages = [ ];
    openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = sshkeys;
  };

  # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
  # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
  # on your system were taken. It's perfectly fine and recommended to leave
  # this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
  # Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
  # (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
  system.stateVersion = "23.05"; # Did you read the comment?
}
```

Then, install:

```sh
time sudo nixos-install --no-root-password
```

Set a root password:

```sh
sudo passwd --root /mnt root
```

Reboot:

```sh
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## If things go wrong...

If the system does not boot, and you need to reconfigure it using the
installation media, reboot from the installation media.

Then, note the disk ID as it may have changed:

```sh
lsblk --fs
```

In my case, it is still `/dev/sda`. Find yours, and export it as a shell
environment variable:

```sh
export DEVICE_ROOT="/dev/sda"
```

Open encrypted luks:

```sh
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen "/dev/${DEVICE_ROOT}2" enc-pv
```

Mount stuff:

```sh
sudo lvchange -a y /dev/vg/swap
sudo lvchange -a y /dev/vg/root
sudo mount /dev/vg/root /mnt
sudo mount "${DEVICE_ROOT}1" /mnt/boot
sudo swapon /dev/vg/swap
```

Make your changes and re-install:

```sh
time sudo nixos-install
```

That's it.
