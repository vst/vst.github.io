This is not about improving productivity, but rather a simple but bottom-up hack
to improve personal awareness and accountability and extend it to the team.
Productivity should be a natural byproduct of that.

It is important how we plan, but more important is how we execute and adapt to
the ever-changing environment.

Any plan without operational touch is just a wish list. Any day full of doing
but lacking clear direction is just another wasted one.

Which one follows which? It is a chicken-and-egg situation.

## The Z Report

A long time ago, my business partner took a month off. Not that he asked for it,
but I sent him an email every single day with a list of things I did or that
came up during the day.

Forget the value of the list for the business or even for him -- what I learned
was that I had been floating through the day.

Once I started _documenting_ the day, I realised how easy it is to derail and do
the _wrong things_. Ask me in the evening -- I worked all day. But what did I
actually deliver? Nothing. I recently learned that it even has a name: _motion_
versus _action_.

In point-of-sale systems, a **Z Report** is the summary that closes the register
at the end of the day. For me, it became my personal audit log -- a simple way
to close the day with awareness.

A good Z Report is not just a list of tasks. It is a reflection. A checkpoint. A
mirror. It should not be complex or long, but it should be honest and clear. No
need for elaborate tooling. Just a log -- something to end the day with a sense
of clarity.

This is how I managed to do it for a very long time without giving up.

## The Weekly Review

At the end of 2022, I automated the habit. A GitHub Action would open a "Daily
Review" issue for me every day -- seven days a week -- with a template that
changes over time. I only skipped one day! Around the same time, another GitHub
Action would create a "Weekly Review and Plan" issue every Sunday.

The intent was not to project-manage myself or my team. The goal was simpler: to
X-ray the week. To observe patterns. To reveal where we thought we were going
and where we actually landed.

The first thing I noticed: the weekly plans were too ambitious. And the daily
routines were too scattered. Toning down the weekly goals and dropping
unimportant chores helped immediately. Energy and focus are finite. The _Weekly
Review_ made that painfully obvious.

Eventually, I extended the practice to the team. Each member had their own
version of the daily issue. It was never mandatory. Whether written or not, the
daily report helped everyone realise what was being left undone.

I do not claim this made us a more productive team. But it made us a **wiser**
team -- one more aware of its own limitations and dynamics.

We are now extending this practice to monthly and quarterly tasks and reviews,
and integrating our compliance and audit practices into the same routine.

## Reflection as Operational Practice

Together, **Z Reports** and **Weekly Reviews** form a valuable feedback loop:

- Z Reports help you close the day with clarity.
- Weekly Reviews let you step back and adjust direction.

After years of doing this, I have a better idea of where my time goes, what I
keep postponing, why I fail to ship and what strategies fail to fix these.

I think that it is a pretty good return on investment for a 10-minute daily
review and a 30-minute weekly reflection.

## Close the Register, Open the Week

I do not claim that I have found the perfect productivity system. There are so
many tools, methodologies and frameworks out there, some of which I have tried
and many I have not. I am also aware that tools change as we change, our
environment changes and our needs change, temporarily or permanently.

What I do claim, however, is that self-awareness, accountability and persistence
are the keys to improving your own productivity and that of your team. As tools
need to change, you do not need to change the overarching principles and
practices: You will still need to close the day with a Z Report and you will
still need to review the week and plan the next one.

That is the lifehack.
