Today marks the final day of my second month-long blogging challenge. The first
was in [August] last year. This one, in May, felt different -- but just as
transformative.

Here are my takeaways.

## The grind is real -- and it teaches you

I have a few jobs to do, with different hats to wear. I also have a family. So,
blogging almost always happened late in the evenings.

Some evenings I had not even thought about what to write until 9pm-10pm. Then I
had to find a topic, write, and publish. It was stressful and felt like a grind.
But this taught me something important: **grind is everywhere**.

If you are a marketer, you grind to get leads. If you are a developer, you grind
to fix bugs and run chores for housekeeping. The examples may change, but the
grind stays.

If your job never feels like a grind, maybe you are lucky. But maybe not. Grind,
in some form, is inevitable. The real question is -- how do you face it without
burning out or dropping the ball?

## I wanted to quit around Day 15

I distinctly remember telling myself: "Enough. This is too stressful." But I
kept going. It was doable -- and I am glad I resisted the urge to quit.

## Streaks help with accountability

There is something motivating about not breaking the chain. It is visual,
tangible and slightly addictive in a way, and I hope it is in a good way.

## Constraints trigger creativity

Do not get me wrong -- I am not claiming to be a creative person.

But a daily deadline forces you to think faster, write leaner, and sometimes
take unusual angles. That is a good thing. Constraints are not limits -- they
are frameworks.

More about constraints in a future post!

## It is possible to write a blog post in less than 2 hours

It depends on the topic, the depth, and how prepared I am. My motivation was
twofold:

1. The key is to just start.
2. Not every post needs to be perfect, long or deep.

And it worked for me. I wrote some posts in under an hour, and mostly in less
than two.

## Quantity over quality

That perfectionism kept me from blogging for the longest time. The [August]
exercise helped me to overcome that. I was told that "quantity leads to
quality". That might sound counterintuitive, but it is true.

As an old drummer, I can tell that the more you practice, and the more grinding
the practice is, the better you get.

Why should writing be any different?

My motto was: _just hit publish_. Not everything needs to be perfect. So, I
learned that letting go is a skill that needs to be practiced too.

## Writing helps me learn

Often, I catch myself saying, "Wait, is that even true?" It made me go and
verify lots of things this month.

I suppose that this is normal: writing requires clarity and clarity requires
learning.

## Crossposting revealed what people actually read

I post to [dev.to] and [Hashnode]. Over time, I am starting to understand which
posts resonate and which do not.

I also have a clearer sense of what I enjoy writing about.

## I now have a content archive

A month of blog posts is not just a streak -- it is a body of work, regardless
of quality. I can build on these or turn them into something more later.

## I showed up for myself

In the end, this challenge was a commitment to myself. I kept that promise. That
builds confidence and internal trust -- something no metric can measure.

## What next?

After my first challenge, I told myself that I should write occasionally, which
I did not. That was a mistake.

Now, I should really try to keep the momentum going.

Thinking of trying your own challenge? Start small. You might just learn more
than you expect.
